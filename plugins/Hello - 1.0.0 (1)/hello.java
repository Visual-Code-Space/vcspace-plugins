/*
 * This is a sample plugin script for Visual Code Space.
 *
 * This script serves as the entry point for your plugin. The 'main' function is
 * the default method that will be executed when your plugin is loaded and started.
 *
 * Follow this template to create your own plugin by adding custom logic inside the 'main' function.
 * You can use Android-specific features and classes, as well as interact with the app using
 * provided objects like 'app' and 'helper'.
 *
 * The 'app' object refers to the Application instance of this app, allowing you to access various
 * application-level features and context.
 *
 * The 'helper' object provides additional utility methods to assist with plugin development.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * - Display a Toast message to the user
 * - Add custom behavior or UI elements to your app
 * - Interact with existing app components
 *
 * Modifying the Entry Point:
 * - By default, the entry point is set to the 'main' function.
 * - You can change the entry point by modifying the 'entryPoint' field in the plugin's manifest.
 * - Set 'entryPoint' to the name of any other function in this script that you want to execute when the plugin is loaded.
 * - Example: To use 'startPlugin' as the entry point, set 'entryPoint: "startPlugin"' in the manifest.

void main() {
  // Display a simple Toast message when the plugin is loaded
  Toast.makeText(app, "Hello from plugin!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();

  // Add your custom plugin logic here
  // For example, you could interact with other components of the app, create new UI elements, etc.

  // Additional Example 1: Print a message to the logcat
  // Log.d("Plugin", "Plugin is running!");

  // Additional Example 2: Start an Android Activity from the plugin
  // Intent intent = new Intent(app, YourTargetActivity.class);
  // intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
  // app.startActivity(intent);

  // Remember to keep the 'main' function parameterless for it to be correctly identified and executed.
}

// Example of an alternative entry point
void startPlugin() {
  // Custom logic that can be used as the entry point if specified in the manifest
  Toast.makeText(app, "startPlugin function executed!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
}
